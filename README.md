--Project Description:
- This game is Tetris. The goal is to make full rows out of the shapes to clear the lines.
- You must also avoid reaching the top, or you lose.
- Once a line is filled up it is cleared, moving lines above down.
- Random shapes appear at the top that you can rotate and move left, right or down.
- Once a shape hits the bottom of the board or is on top of another block you cannot move it.
- Only falling blocks can be moved.
